sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it solved sorted text the fastest, because of it's algorithm it checks if there is no swap then it is already sorted and finish executing.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it is the fastest to solve between the others, especially on big data random/reversed 50000.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it is the slowest one, because it algorithm must go through the whole n amount of data even though it is already sorted
